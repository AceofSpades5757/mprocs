# mprocs

_mprocs_ runs multiple commands in parallel and shows output of each command
separately.

When you work on a project you very often need the same list of commands to be
running. For example: `webpack serve`, `jest --watch`, `node src/server.js`.
With mprocs you can list these command in `mprocs.json` and run all of them by
running `mprocs`. Then you can switch between outputs of running commands and
interact with them.

It is simmilar to
[concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently) but _mprocs_
shows output of each command separately and allows to interact with processes
(you can even work in _vim_ inside _mprocs_).

{
  "procs": {
    "nvim": {
      "cmd": ["nvim"]
    },
    "server": {
      "shell": "nodemon server.js"
    },
    "webpack": {
      "shell": "webpack serve"
    },
    "tests": {

    }
  }
}
```
